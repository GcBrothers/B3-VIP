Here is a beta version for vip Plugin for B3 (game Urban Terror)

VIP plugin allows you to protect players against opponents !
You can use 3 modes : !vip <client> : you select a player by telling b3 his name, and everyone who will damage him will get slapped
                      !vip random : b3 selects a random player, and when he dies another player is chosen
                      !vip all : everyone is protected (and gets slapped too)
(note that you can turn off the plugin too by saying !vip off)

Installation : copy vip.py and conf folder into your b3 extplugins folder; update the b3.xml file : in plugins add <plugin name="proxyfilter" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/vip.ini" />

Have fun !
